## We develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host the code, track issues and feature requests.

## Code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code passes the linters.
6. Open that pull request!

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/thedevcore/apollo-cache-lite/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue - it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Provide a sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes - possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work
